# Blurry faces

[Blurry faces website](https://willybrauner.github.io/blurry-faces)

Blurry Faces is a client-side application that automatically detects faces on web pages and blurs them.
A zip file can be download with the burry images collection, and that's it!

## How it works?

The app uses [face-api]("https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/") to detect faces on images. The images are not saved anywhere, you can check the source code :)
